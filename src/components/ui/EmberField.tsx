 *
 * Implemented as absolutely-positioned divs driven by GSAP rather than a
 * `<canvas>` and a `requestAnimationFrame` loop. That keeps it inside the house
 * animation rule (all motion is GSAP inside `useGSAP`), lets GSAP's context
 * handle teardown, and animates only `y`/`x`/`opacity`/`scale`, all of which the
 * compositor can run off the main thread.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when the visitor prefers reduced motion — a static
 * scatter of dots would just be visual noise with no meaning.
