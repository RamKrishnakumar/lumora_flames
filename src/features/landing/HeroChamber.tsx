/**
 * HeroChamber is the home page's opening screen: centred display type standing
 * in a dark chamber lit by a single candle.
 *
 * ## Why it is built this way
 *
 * The hero was previously type on a flat background, which for a brand whose
 * entire metaphor is light meant the first screen was unlit. Rather than add a
 * 3D library or another multi-megabyte photograph — imagery is already the
 * app's dominant payload — this composes four cheap layers:
 *
 * 1. a radial amber light pool that breathes, the *cast light*;
 * 2. {@link EmberField}, sparks rising as though a flame burns off-frame;
 * 3. {@link InteractiveCandleCanvas}, the existing procedural candle, scaled up
 *    and cropped by the bottom edge so it reads as being in the room with you;
 * 4. the headline, genuinely centred in a column.
 *
 * Total added image weight: zero.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * Everything animates transform and opacity only. On scroll the type drifts up
 * and the light pool dims, so leaving the hero reads as the candle being carried
 * out of the room. On desktop, pointer movement parallaxes the candle and pool
 * against each other for shallow depth.
 *
 * With reduced motion preferred: no embers, no breathing, no parallax, no scroll
 * fade. The candle still renders lit and the pool still glows, so the screen is
 * a lit chamber even when perfectly still.

        {/* Layer 2 — cast light. The outer node's opacity and scale are scrubbed
            to match the flame's size; the inner one breathes on a loop. Split in
            two so the two animations never write the same property.

            A square box centred on the wick, not `inset-0`.

            `inset-0` made this the viewport's shape, and a background is clipped
            to its element's box — so with the gradient's origin down at the wick,
            the bottom edge sat ~14vmax away while the far corner needed ~60vmax.
            The gradient was still carrying visible alpha when the box ran out, and
            that cut edge is the rectangle. Scrubbing made it worse rather than
            better: `scale(0.55)` shrinks the clip box to 792×495 *inside* a
            1440×900 screen, putting all four cut edges in plain view mid-ignition.

            Square and wick-centred instead, so every edge is equidistant from the
            origin and the falloff completes inside the box on all sides — there is
            no edge left to reveal, at any scale. `-mx-` / `-my-` negative margins
            do the centring rather than `-translate-x-1/2`: GSAP owns `transform`
            on this node (scrub) and would silently drop a Tailwind translate.

            Sized `200vmax` so the shortest half-width (100vmax) still exceeds the
            farthest corner from the wick, measured at 66–85vmax across 390px to
            1920px. `top-[76%]` is the wick, which sits at 68–76% of viewport
            height depending on where the candle's responsive scale lands. */}

      {/* Blow-out smoke. Outside the stage on purpose, and the reason is worth
          keeping: the stage and the candle wrapper are both transformed, and a
          transform creates a stacking context, which seals every descendant into
          that node's paint slot regardless of its own `z-index`. Nested at the
          wick — where it used to be — the smoke could not rise in front of the
          headline no matter what `z-index` it carried.

          Lifting the whole candle above the type instead was measurably wrong: at
          1024×768 the vessel body overlaps the headline, so the wax would occlude
          glyphs. Only the smoke moves.

          `z-20` clears the type's `z-10`; positioned at the wick by `placeSmoke`,
          since out here it no longer inherits the candle's geometry. */}
